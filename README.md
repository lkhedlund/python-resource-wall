# Python/Django Resource Wall
A simple web app I used as a way to practice writing Django apps. I forked a previous project so that I could focus on learning the framework and applying some of the features in a new way.

# Get started
Visit the app at [http://lkhedlund.pythonanywhere.com/](http://lkhedlund.pythonanywhere.com/) and log in
using the guest credentials:
Username: `yamnuska` Password: `rockies1`

# Features to be added
- Sort by tag or created date
- Improved bootstrap styling
- User profile and login
- Search function
